# Sorting-Visualizer

Programmed a visualizer to depict 5 complex sorting algorithms - Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. Generate a new array by clicking the button ar refresh the page. 
Algorithms are in sorting algorithms folder. Sort the array and input each sorted changes to a new array called animations array. Use animations array to visualize the sorting process by first highlighting the currently sorted elements and then changing the height of array bars. 
Inserted slider to alter the speed of sorting process.
Created robust testing algorithm to test all algorithms to 10K different set of inputs. If the array is not sorted as compared to inbuilt javascript sorting method return false in console log.
